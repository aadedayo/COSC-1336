# COSC-1336
PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS - COSC 1336 introduce the fundamental concepts of procedural programming. Topics covered include data
types, control structures, functions, arrays, files, and the mechanics of running, testing, and debugging. The
course also offers an introduction to the historical and social context of computing and an overview of
computer science as a discipline. 


These are some of the C programs i wrote in this class.

# File Name - Bank.cpp
* This was a program i wrote as one of my projects in programming fundamentals.
* It is a basic programming that any upcoming developer should be able to write.
* The program's purpose is basically to check bank informations for customers and there are few comments in the programs showing how i did that.

# File Name - Fraction.cpp
* This was a program i wrote as one of my projects in programming fundamentals.
* Things started getting interesting here, dealing with functions, loops, and conditions. But i still classfiy it as basic because i know how complicated programing can get.
* The program's purpose is basically to calculate multiplication and divisions for fractions and there are few comments in the programs showing how i did that.

# File Name - FP5.cpp
* This was the last program i wrote in programming fundamentals.
* I think this one is a little complicated, i had a lot of help getting it done. It basically covered everything i learned throughout the semester. However, if you take it step by step, it's easy to comprehend.
* The program's purpose is to create a movie theater management system.
